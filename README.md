# CoolCam
ICS4U Semester Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a camera applcation written in python, that can detect hand and facial gestures and alter the effects of the camera in accordance with those gestures.

### Goal
By the midle of June, my goal is to complete the project, at least with all the tracking features and machine learning to detect the gestures. If I have enough time, I would like to implement a feature that can detect faces and create profiles for them with their own gestures and effects.

### Technology Used
I will mainly use Python to develop the app, likely using libraries such as Tkinter or PyGame to aid in the visual aspects of the app, however I can't be completely sure as to what technology will be implemented in the final product.
